This repository is a collection of analysis scripts to process Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) images  collected to understand the role of Aldehyde responsive quorum-sensing Inhibitor (ArqI) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For details on data collection and interpretation, see the full manuscript "A novel glyoxal-specific aldehyde signaling axis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that influences quorum sensing and infection" by Dr Christopher Corcoran from the lab of Dr Andrew Ulijasz.
